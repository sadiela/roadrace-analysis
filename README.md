# Roadrace Analysis
Ultimate goal: interface (perhaps GUI) to analyze road race results. This will consist of several parts:

1. **RunSignUp API Interface**: Code for scraping race results from the RunSignUp API
2. **Data Visualization**: Code for visualizing race data in various ways. 

### To Do:
* CLI for RunSignUp API: Not all races on RunSignUp surface their results. I want to be able to poke around the API and make sure there are results before I try to do any scraping. I also want to be able to look at a list of races in a particular state/time period and pick the one I'm interested in. 
* Basic visualization: set of basic race data visualizations for initial analysis.
